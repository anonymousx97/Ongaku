A **smol and fluffy** bot to update your telegram bio with music playing around you (Pixel) or on your android phone in real time!

### Requirements
* An android device capable of running Termux
* A music player app capable of showing notifications of current music being played
* Optionally a Google Pixel device if you want to detect Music playing around you.
### Getting started

* Install [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) and [Termux:API](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.api/) apps from F-Droid.
* Launch Termux and run the following command

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anonymousx97/Ongaku/main/scripts/installation.sh)"
```

Optionally you can also add neofetch support by running

```
apt install -y neofetch python-pillow
```

You will be asked to provide notification access to Termux:API app. You must provide Termux:API app all the required permissions. You may be required to do `Ctrl+C` to continue.
> On A13 and above you might need to allow restricted setting permission to the api before allowing notification access.

* When you run the Ongaku for the first time you are asked to enter your phone number to create a session. Ongaku uses this session to work with your telegram account.

* Create a `config.env` file from `sample-config.env`

$ `cd ongaku && cp sample-config.env config.env`

Edit `config.env` as instructed by the file itself.

$ `nano config.env`

* You can get `API_ID` and `API_HASH` from [here](https://my.telegram.org/).

* You can use this [app](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.oF2pks.applicationsinfo/) to check package name of your music player app and add it to `MUSIC_PLAYER` value. If you want to detect Music playing around you (pixel devices only) uncomment `NOW_PLAYING_PIXEL_MODE` and set it to 1. If enabled it will override your Music Player.

* To optionally get `LOG_CHANNEL` create a private telegram channel and send a random message in it. After that forward that message to [@username_to_id_bot](https://t.me/username_to_id_bot) on telegram or [here](https://t.me/username_to_id_bot).

* You can leave out `STRING_SESSION` for now by uncommenting it.

* Starting [IDBot](https://t.me/username_to_id_bot) on telegram will also give you your own ID. Put that in `USERS` value.

Use `Ctrl+X` to exit and save your changes.

* Run `./launch` inside the root `ongaku` directory. You will receive your `STRING_SESSION` in your saved messages in telegram app.

* Copy the session text and edit your `config.env` file once again by running `nano config.env`

* Paste your session text according to the instructions in the file.

Use `Ctrl+X` to exit and save your changes.

* Run `ong` from any directory to start Ongaku.

* If this is your first time launching Ongaku then you will be asked to enter your phone number to login. Next launches will work without having to re-login.

* If everything went well you should be up and running. At this point you can start playing music and you should see current playing song in the Termux app and your telegram bio.

### Tips

* Ongaku may stop detecting notifications and responding to commands if you `RELEASE WAKELOCK` while it is running! It handles android wakelocks automatically.
* If you frequently switch between multiple music players, you may want to keep multiple `config.env` files. You can make any number of `.env` files named like `config-1.env, config-2.env, config-3.env...` and so on. To keep any one the file active at one time, you just have to rename that file to `config.env` and use launch script as usual.

### Known Limitations

* Ongaku cannot yet differentiate between the states of music player itself i.e. `Playing`, `Paused` and `Stopped`. It simply assumes existing music player notification as a `Playing` state.
* It is not yet possible to run Ongaku on a baremetal server or a VPS/PaaS such as Heroku.
* Devices running MIUI are unsupported as Xiaomi loves to corrupt notification permission after X amount of hours and even at each device reboot. However you can still use Ongaku if you are willing to provide notification access manually by uninstalling Termux:API app, reinstalling it again, running `termux-notification-list` and lastly doing `Ctrl + C` each time Ongaku starts malfunctioning! This is something you can also fix by running a reputable custom rom such as [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/). (**#RipBozo** ðŸ’¯ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ if you choose to run MIUI on your phone anyway)

### Optional commands
Send in any DM or Group chat

`.about` to view info about the project.

`.history` to get list of music played in current session.

`.sync` to force sync bio with latest notification.

`.alive` to get environment information in GIF format (not actual mp4 video with no audio scam format).

`.alive -t` to get environment information in text format.
